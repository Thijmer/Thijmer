# Hello, Iâ€™m @Thijmer!
How nice of you to check out my GitHub! Here is a little bit of information about me.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming, 3D and Minecraft.
- ðŸŒ± Programming is my hobby. I am still learning new things every day and I have already made some cool things.
- ðŸ¤“ I like to keep things simple. It is good for many programs to just run in the commandline.
- ðŸ¦š I'm proud of what I've made so if you use my work for anything cool, please tell me! 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: thijmenvoskuilen@gmail.com
